To address the rise in traffic accidents caused by the growing older driver population, this study propose an Inverse Reinforcement Learning-based framework for multidimensional and quantitative assessment of driving competence.
The framework build reference agents for older and younger drivers and employs TA-Adv and TA-dSNIPS metrics to precisely evaluate driving performance across safety, rule compliance, efficiency, and comfort.
