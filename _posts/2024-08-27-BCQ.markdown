This study presents an RL-based decision-support framework for heparin dosing in the ICU, employing Batch-Constrained Q-Learning (BCQ) with rigorous off-policy evaluation. Trained and validated on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, the learned policies outperform clinician strategies and align with therapeutic aPTT targets, establishing a foundation for reliable RL-based systems in critical care.
