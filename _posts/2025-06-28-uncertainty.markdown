An uncertainty-aware reinforcement learning framework is introduced to quantify policy uncertainty and mitigate unsafe dosing behaviors that arise in OOD patient states.
By applying action entropy, energy-based scoring, and ensemble Q-value variance, the method detect high-risk recommendations with strong accuracy, enabling clinician overrides and enhancing the safety and interpretability of ICU treatment policies.
